# What is Programming ?

<v-click>

üìì Dictionary
- The <mark>proccess</mark> or <mark>activity</mark> of writing computer programs.

</v-click>

<v-click>

- Programming is the process of creating a <mark>set of instructions</mark> that tell a computer how to perform a task

</v-click>

---

###### What is Programming ?
# Purpose Of Programming

- Purpose of programming is to make human life better and easier. It does so because the computer programs can perform a set of tasks once we define them clearly.
    <br/>
    * Calculator
    * Automated Teller Machine (ATM)

- This saves a lot of human time and energy so that we can concentrate on other challenging tasks that cannot be automated.

<br/>

<blockquote>
"Everyone should learn how to program regardless of what profession we are doing. With this programming knowledge, we can optimize our task easily and efficiently"
</blockquote>

<!-- - What is the Purpose of Programming? 
- I mean, why do you do it and where is it going?
-  Where should it be going? -->

###### What is Programming ?
# The language of Code

<v-click>

- Computers only understand <mark>machine code</mark>
- A series of 1's and 0' fed and interpreted by the computer (BINARY)

</v-click>

---

###### What is Programming ?
# Binary

<v-click>

- A binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: typically "0" and "1". 
- Therefore, in order to talk to computer you must first translate your English instructions to Binary.

###### What is Programming ?
# Two types of programming languages

<v-click>

- Each language also has an attribute known as <span class="text-red-500">power</span> or <span class="text-green-500">level</span>
- Till now, thousands of programming languages have come into form. All of them have their own specific purposes.
- All of these languages have a variation in terms of the level of abstraction that they all provide from the hardware. 
- A few of these languages provide less or no abstraction at all, while the others provide a very high abstraction. On the basis of this level of abstraction, there are two types of programming languages:
  - <span>High-level languages</span>
  - <span>Low-level languages</span>

</v-click>

---

###### What is Programming ?
# High-level languages

- One can easily interpret and combine these languages as compared to the low-level languages.
- They are very easy to understand.
- Such languages are programmer-friendly.
- Debugging is not very difficult.
- They come with easy maintenance and are thus simple and manageable.
- One can easily run them on different platforms.
- They require a compiler/interpreter for translation into a machine code.
- A user can port them from one location to another.
- Such languages have a low efficiency of memory. So it consumes more memory than the low-level languages.
- They are very widely used and popular in today‚Äôs times.
- Java, C, C++, Python, etc., are a few examples of high-level languages.

---

###### What is Programming ?
# Low-level languages

- They are also called machine-level languages.
- Machines can easily understand it.
- High-level languages are very machine-friendly.
- Debugging them is very difficult.
- They are not very easy to understand.
- All the languages come with complex maintenance.
- They are not portable.
- These languages depend on machines. Thus, one can run it on various platforms.
- They always require assemblers for translating instructions.
- Low-level languages do not have a very wide application in today‚Äôs times.
- Machine language, Assembly, C,  are examples of low-level languages.

# Learning Languages

<v-click>

- Learning a computer language can be very similar to learning a real language (It takes time)

</v-click>

<v-click>

- All programming languages have as <mark>set of rules</mark> you must follow when writing code in that language just like in real languages

</v-click>

<v-click>

- In computer science it is called <mark>syntax</mark>, Similar to <mark>grammar</mark> in real life languages

###### How do we write Code ?
# What is Syntax ?

<v-click>

- <mark>Syntax</mark>: Rules you must follow if you want your program to run correctly
  - How do you type out certain functions
  - What you put at the end of each line of code
  - How you set up certain functions

</v-click>

<v-click>

- Syntax for each programming languages is <span class="text-green-600">unique</span>

</v-click>

<v-click>

- What if you mess up ?
  - Your entire program will not run and send you back a <span class="text-red-600">syntax error</span>

</v-click>

<v-click>

- Built-In error check
  - Another cool thing about IDE's is that they will let you know if and when there are <mark>syntax error</mark> in your code
    - it usually <span class="underline decoration-red-500">underlined in red</span>

###### Introduction to C++
# What is C++?

- C++ is a <mark>cross-platform language</mark> that can be used to create high-performance applications.

- C++ was developed by <mark>Bjarne Stroustrup</mark>, as an extension to the C language.

- C++ is a <mark>middle-level language</mark> rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.)

---

###### Introduction to C++
# Advantages of C++

- <mark>Multi-paradigm Language</mark> - C++ supports at least seven different styles of programming. Developers can choose any of the styles.
- <mark>General Purpose Language</mark> - You can use C++ to develop games, desktop apps, operating systems, and so on.
- <mark>Speed</mark> - Like C programming, the performance of optimized C++ code is exceptional.
- <mark>Object-oriented</mark> - C++ allows you to divide complex problems into smaller sets by using objects.

---

###### Introduction to C++
# Why Use C++

- C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.
- C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems (Windows OS)
- C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
- C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
- C++ is fun and easy to learn!
- As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.

```

 Extremely Powerful apps written in C++

 - Google
 - Amazon
 - Youtube 
 - Windows OS
 - Microsoft Office

3. `Line 3: A blank line.` C++ ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable.

</v-click>

<v-click>

4. `Line 4: Another thing that always appear in a C++ program, is int main().` This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.

</v-click>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello [YourFamilyName]!";
  return 0;
}
```

5. `Line 5: cout (pronounced "see-out")` is an object used together with the insertion operator (<<) to output/print text. In our example it will output "Hello World".

> Note: Every C++ statement ends with a semicolon ;.

> Note: The body of int main() could also been written as:
int main () { cout << "Hello World! "; return 0; } 

</v-click>

<v-click>

6. `Line 6: return 0 ` ends the main function.

</v-click>

<v-click>

7. `Line 7: Do not forget to add the closing curly bracket }` to actually end the main function.

</v-click>

::right::

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello [YourFamilyName]!";
  return 0;

# New lines in C++

<v-click>

To insert a new line, you can use the \n character:

`https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World! \n";
  cout << "I am learning C++";
  return 0;
}
```

</v-click>

###### Introduction to C++
# New lines in C++

<v-click>

Tip: Two \n characters after each other will create a blank line:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World! \n\n";
  cout << "I am learning C++";
  return 0;
}
```

</v-click>

Another way to insert a new line, is with the endl manipulator:

<v-click>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
  cout << "I am learning C++";
  return 0;
}

# C++ Comments
## Introduction to C++

###### Introduction to C++
# Comments

<v-click>

Comments can be used to explain C++ code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code. Comments can be `singled-lined` or `multi-lined`.

</v-click>

::window::

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  // The code below will print the words Hello World!
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
```

---
layout: text-window
---

###### Introduction to C++
# Single-line comments

<v-click>

Single-line comments start with two forward slashes `//`.

Any text between `//` and the end of the line is ignored by the compiler (will not be executed).

This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:

</v-click>

::window::

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  // This is a comment
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
```

-

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!"; // This is a comment
  return 0;
}
```

---
layout: text-window
---

###### Introduction to C++
# Multi-line comments

<v-click>

Multi-line comments start with `/*`and ends with `*/`.

Any text between `/* and */` will be ignored by the compiler:

</v-click>

::window::

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  /* The code below will print the words Hello World! */
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
```

-

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  /* The code below will print the words Hello World!
     to the screen, and it is amazing 
  */  
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}

# Variables and types
## Introduction to C++

###### Introduction to C++
# Variables and types

<v-click>

Variables are containers for storing data values.

</v-click>

<v-click>

In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

</v-click>

<v-click>

- `int` 
  - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
  - Its size is usually 4 bytes. Meaning, it can store values from -2147483648 to 2147483647.

For example,
```cpp
int salary = 85000;
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

- `double` 
   - stores floating point numbers, with decimals and exponentials, such as 19.99 or -19.99
   - The size of double is 8 bytes

For example,
```cpp
double volume = 134.64534;
```

</v-click>

---

###### Introduction to C++
# Variables and types

<v-click>

- `float` 
   - store floating-point numbers (decimals and exponentials).
   - The size of float is 4 bytes

For example,
```cpp
float area = 64.74;
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

- `char` 
  - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
  - Its size is 1 byte.

For example,
```cpp
char test = 'h';
```

</v-click>

---

###### Introduction to C++
# Variables and types

<v-click>

- `wchar_t` 
  - Wide character wchar_t is similar to the char data type, except its size is 2 bytes instead of 1.
  - It is used to represent characters that require more memory to represent them than a single char.

For example,
```cpp
wchar_t test = L'◊ù'  // storing Hebrew character;
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

- `string` - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes

For example,
```cpp
string myText = "Hello"; // String
```

</v-click>

---

###### Introduction to C++
# Variables and types

<v-click>

- `bool` - stores values with two states: true or false

For example,
```cpp
bool cond = false;
```

</v-click>

---
layout: text-window
---

###### Variables
# Declaring Variables

Syntax for declaring variables:

`type variableName = value;`

::window::

```cpp
int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number)
float myFloatNum = 5.99;     // Floating point number
double myDoubleNum = 9.98;   // Floating point number
char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
bool myBoolean = true;       // Boolean
string myText = "Hello";     // String
```

###### Introduction to C++
# C++ User Input

<v-click>

- You have already learned that `cout` is used to output (print) values. Now we will use `cin` to get user input.

- `cin` is a predefined variable that reads data from the keyboard with the extraction operator (`>>`).

</v-click>

<v-click>

In the following example, the user can input a number, which is stored in the variable x. Then we print the value of x:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int x;
  cout << "Type a number: "; // Type a number and press enter
  cin >> x; // Get user input from the keyboard
  cout << "Your number is: " << x;
  return 0;
}

```

  cin >> x; // Get user input from the keyboard
  cout << "Your number is: " << x;
  return 0;
}
```

<v-click>

`cout` is pronounced "see-out". Used for output, and uses the insertion operator (`<<`)

</v-click>
<v-click>

`cin` is pronounced "see-in". Used for input, and uses the extraction operator (`>>`)
