# What is Programming ?

<v-click>

üìì Dictionary
- The <mark>proccess</mark> or <mark>activity</mark> of writing computer programs.

</v-click>

<v-click>

- Programming is the process of creating a <mark>set of instructions</mark> that tell a computer how to perform a task

</v-click>

---

###### What is Programming ?
# Purpose Of Programming

- Purpose of programming is to make human life better and easier. It does so because the computer programs can perform a set of tasks once we define them clearly.
    <br/>
    * Calculator
    * Automated Teller Machine (ATM)

- This saves a lot of human time and energy so that we can concentrate on other challenging tasks that cannot be automated.

<br/>

<blockquote>
"Everyone should learn how to program regardless of what profession we are doing. With this programming knowledge, we can optimize our task easily and efficiently"
</blockquote>

<!-- - What is the Purpose of Programming? 
- I mean, why do you do it and where is it going?
-  Where should it be going? -->

###### What is Programming ?
# The language of Code

<v-click>

- Computers only understand <mark>machine code</mark>
- A series of 1's and 0' fed and interpreted by the computer (BINARY)

</v-click>

---

###### What is Programming ?
# Binary

<v-click>

- A binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: typically "0" and "1". 
- Therefore, in order to talk to computer you must first translate your English instructions to Binary.

###### What is Programming ?
# Two types of programming languages

<v-click>

- Each language also has an attribute known as <span class="text-red-500">power</span> or <span class="text-green-500">level</span>
- Till now, thousands of programming languages have come into form. All of them have their own specific purposes.
- All of these languages have a variation in terms of the level of abstraction that they all provide from the hardware. 
- A few of these languages provide less or no abstraction at all, while the others provide a very high abstraction. On the basis of this level of abstraction, there are two types of programming languages:
  - <span>High-level languages</span>
  - <span>Low-level languages</span>

</v-click>

---

###### What is Programming ?
# High-level languages

- One can easily interpret and combine these languages as compared to the low-level languages.
- They are very easy to understand.
- Such languages are programmer-friendly.
- Debugging is not very difficult.
- They come with easy maintenance and are thus simple and manageable.
- One can easily run them on different platforms.
- They require a compiler/interpreter for translation into a machine code.
- A user can port them from one location to another.
- Such languages have a low efficiency of memory. So it consumes more memory than the low-level languages.
- They are very widely used and popular in today‚Äôs times.
- Java, C, C++, Python, etc., are a few examples of high-level languages.

---

###### What is Programming ?
# Low-level languages

- They are also called machine-level languages.
- Machines can easily understand it.
- High-level languages are very machine-friendly.
- Debugging them is very difficult.
- They are not very easy to understand.
- All the languages come with complex maintenance.
- They are not portable.
- These languages depend on machines. Thus, one can run it on various platforms.
- They always require assemblers for translating instructions.
- Low-level languages do not have a very wide application in today‚Äôs times.
- Machine language, Assembly, C,  are examples of low-level languages.

# IDE's

<v-click>

- We use IDE's (Integrated Development Environment) to <mark>write code</mark>
  - A place to write, run, and debug code.
  - Also convert it to machine code.

</v-click>

<v-click>

- IDE's are like any other program on your computer except used for the facilitation of code
  - Examples (Netbeans, IntelliJ, Android Studio, Visual Studio)

# Learning Languages

<v-click>

- Learning a computer language can be very similar to learning a real language (It takes time)

</v-click>

<v-click>

- All programming languages have as <mark>set of rules</mark> you must follow when writing code in that language just like in real languages

</v-click>

<v-click>

- In computer science it is called <mark>syntax</mark>, Similar to <mark>grammar</mark> in real life languages

###### How do we write Code ?
# What is Syntax ?

<v-click>

- <mark>Syntax</mark>: Rules you must follow if you want your program to run correctly
  - How do you type out certain functions
  - What you put at the end of each line of code
  - How you set up certain functions

</v-click>

<v-click>

- Syntax for each programming languages is <span class="text-green-600">unique</span>

</v-click>

<v-click>

- Breaking programming rules will result in an <span class="text-red-600">error</span>

<v-click>

- What if you mess up ?
  - Your entire program will not run and send you back a <span class="text-red-600">syntax error</span>

</v-click>

<v-click>

- Built-In error check
  - Another cool thing about IDE's is that they will let you know if and when there are <mark>syntax error</mark> in your code
    - it usually <span class="underline decoration-red-500">underlined in red</span>

# How to use Console 

<v-click>

###### Introduction to C++
# What is C++?

- C++ is a <mark>cross-platform language</mark> that can be used to create high-performance applications.

- C++ was developed by <mark>Bjarne Stroustrup</mark>, as an extension to the C language.

- C++ is a <mark>middle-level language</mark> rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.)

---

###### Introduction to C++
# Advantages of C++

- <mark>Multi-paradigm Language</mark> - C++ supports at least seven different styles of programming. Developers can choose any of the styles.
- <mark>General Purpose Language</mark> - You can use C++ to develop games, desktop apps, operating systems, and so on.
- <mark>Speed</mark> - Like C programming, the performance of optimized C++ code is exceptional.
- <mark>Object-oriented</mark> - C++ allows you to divide complex problems into smaller sets by using objects.

---

###### Introduction to C++
# Why Use C++

- C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.
- C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems (Windows OS)
- C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
- C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
- C++ is fun and easy to learn!
- As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.

```

 Extremely Powerful apps written in C++

 - Google
 - Amazon
 - Youtube 
 - Windows OS
 - Microsoft Office

1. `Line 1: #include <iostream>` is a header file library that lets us work with input and output objects, such as cout (used in line 5). Header files add functionality to C++ programs.`

</v-click>

<v-click>

2. `Line 2: using namespace std` means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.

3. `Line 3: A blank line.` C++ ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable.

4. `Line 4: Another thing that always appear in a C++ program, is int main().` This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.

</v-click>

::right::

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello [YourFamilyName]!";
  return 0;
}

5. `Line 5: cout (pronounced "see-out")` is an object used together with the insertion operator (<<) to output/print text. In our example it will output "Hello World".

> Note: Every C++ statement ends with a semicolon ;.

> Note: The body of int main() could also been written as:
int main () { cout << "Hello World! "; return 0; }

6. `Line 6: return 0 ` ends the main function.

</v-click>

<v-click>

7. `Line 7: Do not forget to add the closing curly bracket }` to actually end the main function.

</v-click>

::right::

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello [YourFamilyName]!";
  return 0;
}
