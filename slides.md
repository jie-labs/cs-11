# The 7 Rules

- ✋ **Be present** - 1 absent == Explanation letter; 2 absences == DROP
- 👨‍💻 **Hands on your keyboard** - Store everything through computer
- ❌ **Cellphones are not allowed** - Focus is the 🔑
- 😴 **Take a break** - 7 minutes rest for every 40 minutes session
- 🚀 **Self-exploration** - You can basically search and learn everything on the web today.
- 🛠 **Have fun** - grow and learn together
- 💡 **You can't know it all** - As much as you learn, there is still going to be a lot you don't know.
- ✅ **Knowledge >>>>> Grades** - Aim for knowledge and not for grades.

---

# What is Programming ?

<v-click>

📓 Dictionary
- The <mark>proccess</mark> or <mark>activity</mark> of writing computer programs.

</v-click>

<v-click>

- Programming is the process of creating a <mark>set of instructions</mark> that tell a computer how to perform a task

</v-click>

---

###### What is Programming ?
# Purpose Of Programming

- Purpose of programming is to make human life better and easier. It does so because the computer programs can perform a set of tasks once we define them clearly.
    <br/>
    * Calculator
    * Automated Teller Machine (ATM)

- This saves a lot of human time and energy so that we can concentrate on other challenging tasks that cannot be automated.

<br/>

<blockquote>
"Everyone should learn how to program regardless of what profession we are doing. With this programming knowledge, we can optimize our task easily and efficiently"
</blockquote>

<!-- - What is the Purpose of Programming? 
- I mean, why do you do it and where is it going?
-  Where should it be going? -->

###### What is Programming ?
# Computer's are Dumb

<v-click>

- Computer's are only smart because we program them to.

###### What is Programming ?
# The language of Code

<v-click>

- Computers only understand <mark>machine code</mark>
- A series of 1's and 0' fed and interpreted by the computer (BINARY)

</v-click>

---

###### What is Programming ?
# Binary

<v-click>

- A binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: typically "0" and "1". 
- Therefore, in order to talk to computer you must first translate your English instructions to Binary.

# Programming Languages

<v-click>

- Programming languages serve as a middle-man of sorts
- Translate your instructions into <mark>machine code</mark>
	- The series of 0's and 1's that the computer can understand
- Serves as <mark>Interpreters</mark> for converting languages into other languages
  - Faster than converting by hand

###### What is Programming ?
# Two types of programming languages

<v-click>

- Each language also has an attribute known as <span class="text-red-500">power</span> or <span class="text-green-500">level</span>
- Till now, thousands of programming languages have come into form. All of them have their own specific purposes.
- All of these languages have a variation in terms of the level of abstraction that they all provide from the hardware. 
- A few of these languages provide less or no abstraction at all, while the others provide a very high abstraction. On the basis of this level of abstraction, there are two types of programming languages:
  - <span>High-level languages</span>
  - <span>Low-level languages</span>

</v-click>

---

###### What is Programming ?
# High-level languages

- One can easily interpret and combine these languages as compared to the low-level languages.
- They are very easy to understand.
- Such languages are programmer-friendly.
- Debugging is not very difficult.
- They come with easy maintenance and are thus simple and manageable.
- One can easily run them on different platforms.
- They require a compiler/interpreter for translation into a machine code.
- A user can port them from one location to another.
- Such languages have a low efficiency of memory. So it consumes more memory than the low-level languages.
- They are very widely used and popular in today’s times.
- Java, C, C++, Python, etc., are a few examples of high-level languages.

---

###### What is Programming ?
# Low-level languages

- They are also called machine-level languages.
- Machines can easily understand it.
- High-level languages are very machine-friendly.
- Debugging them is very difficult.
- They are not very easy to understand.
- All the languages come with complex maintenance.
- They are not portable.
- These languages depend on machines. Thus, one can run it on various platforms.
- They always require assemblers for translating instructions.
- Low-level languages do not have a very wide application in today’s times.
- Machine language, Assembly, C,  are examples of low-level languages.

# Sending Instructions

<v-click>

- To properly send instructions to the computer we need <span class="text-red-600 underline">programming languages</span>, and...

###### How do we write Code ?
# IDE's

<v-click>

- We use IDE's (Integrated Development Environment) to <mark>write code</mark>
  - A place to write, run, and debug code.
  - Also convert it to machine code.

</v-click>

<v-click>

- IDE's are like any other program on your computer except used for the facilitation of code
  - Examples (Netbeans, IntelliJ, Android Studio, Visual Studio)

###### How do we write Code ?
# IDE Functionality

<v-click>

- In addition to a place to write code, IDE's also include
  - ✅ Built in <span class="text-red-600">Error-checking</span>
  - ✅ <span class="text-red-600">Auto-fill</span> for frequently used words
  - ✅ Project Hierarchy

</v-click>

<v-click>

- A big step up from previously used methods of programming

###### How do we write Code ?
# Learning Languages

<v-click>

- Learning a computer language can be very similar to learning a real language (It takes time)

</v-click>

<v-click>

- All programming languages have as <mark>set of rules</mark> you must follow when writing code in that language just like in real languages

</v-click>

<v-click>

- In computer science it is called <mark>syntax</mark>, Similar to <mark>grammar</mark> in real life languages

###### How do we write Code ?
# What is Syntax ?

<v-click>

- <mark>Syntax</mark>: Rules you must follow if you want your program to run correctly
  - How do you type out certain functions
  - What you put at the end of each line of code
  - How you set up certain functions

</v-click>

<v-click>

- Syntax for each programming languages is <span class="text-green-600">unique</span>

</v-click>

<v-click>

- Breaking programming rules will result in an <span class="text-red-600">error</span>

</v-click>

###### How do we write Code ?
# Ex. Hello World 👨‍💻

<v-click>

```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;
  int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
    // Hello World!
    return 0;
  }
```

```python
  print "Hello World!"
  # display Hello World!
```

```php
  <?php
    echo 'Hello World!';
    // Hello World!
  ?>
```

</v-click>

::right::


<div class="ml-10">

<v-click>

- What if you mess up ?
  - Your entire program will not run and send you back a <span class="text-red-600">syntax error</span>

</v-click>

<v-click>

- Built-In error check
  - Another cool thing about IDE's is that they will let you know if and when there are <mark>syntax error</mark> in your code
    - it usually <span class="underline decoration-red-500">underlined in red</span>
