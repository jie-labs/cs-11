# The 7 Rules

- ‚úã **Be present** - 1 absent == Explanation letter; 2 absences == DROP
- üë®‚Äçüíª **Hands on your keyboard** - Store everything through computer
- ‚ùå **Cellphones are not allowed** - Focus is the üîë
- üò¥ **Take a break** - 7 minutes rest for every 40 minutes session
- üöÄ **Self-exploration** - You can basically search and learn everything on the web today.
- üõ† **Have fun** - grow and learn together
- üí° **You can't know it all** - As much as you learn, there is still going to be a lot you don't know.
- ‚úÖ **Knowledge >>>>> Grades** - Aim for knowledge and not for grades.

# What is Programming ?

<v-click>

üìì Dictionary
- The <mark>proccess</mark> or <mark>activity</mark> of writing computer programs.

</v-click>

<v-click>

- Programming is the process of creating a <mark>set of instructions</mark> that tell a computer how to perform a task

</v-click>

###### What is Programming ?
# Purpose Of Programming

- Purpose of programming is to make human life better and easier. It does so because the computer programs can perform a set of tasks once we define them clearly.
    <br/>
    * Calculator
    * Automated Teller Machine (ATM)

- This saves a lot of human time and energy so that we can concentrate on other challenging tasks that cannot be automated.

<br/>

<blockquote>
"Everyone should learn how to program regardless of what profession we are doing. With this programming knowledge, we can optimize our task easily and efficiently"
</blockquote>

<!-- - What is the Purpose of Programming? 
- I mean, why do you do it and where is it going?
-  Where should it be going? -->

###### What is Programming ?
# Computer's are Dumb

<v-click>

- Computer's are only smart because we program them to.

###### What is Programming ?
# The language of Code

<v-click>

- Computers only understand <mark>machine code</mark>
- A series of 1's and 0' fed and interpreted by the computer (BINARY)

</v-click>

###### What is Programming ?
# Binary

<v-click>

- A binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: typically "0" and "1". 
- Therefore, in order to talk to computer you must first translate your English instructions to Binary.

# Programming Languages

<v-click>

- Programming languages serve as a middle-man of sorts
- Translate your instructions into <mark>machine code</mark>
	- The series of 0's and 1's that the computer can understand
- Serves as <mark>Interpreters</mark> for converting languages into other languages
  - Faster than converting by hand

###### What is Programming ?
# Two types of programming languages

<v-click>

- Each language also has an attribute known as <span class="text-red-500">power</span> or <span class="text-green-500">level</span>
- Till now, thousands of programming languages have come into form. All of them have their own specific purposes.
- All of these languages have a variation in terms of the level of abstraction that they all provide from the hardware. 
- A few of these languages provide less or no abstraction at all, while the others provide a very high abstraction. On the basis of this level of abstraction, there are two types of programming languages:
  - <span>High-level languages</span>
  - <span>Low-level languages</span>
</v-click>

---

###### What is Programming ?
# High-level languages

- One can easily interpret and combine these languages as compared to the low-level languages.
- They are very easy to understand.
- Such languages are programmer-friendly.
- Debugging is not very difficult.
- They come with easy maintenance and are thus simple and manageable.
- One can easily run them on different platforms.
- They require a compiler/interpreter for translation into a machine code.
- A user can port them from one location to another.
- Such languages have a low efficiency of memory. So it consumes more memory than the low-level languages.
- They are very widely used and popular in today‚Äôs times.
- Java, C, C++, Python, etc., are a few examples of high-level languages.

###### What is Programming ?
# Low-level languages

- They are also called machine-level languages.
- Machines can easily understand it.
- High-level languages are very machine-friendly.
- Debugging them is very difficult.
- They are not very easy to understand.
- All the languages come with complex maintenance.
- They are not portable.
- These languages depend on machines. Thus, one can run it on various platforms.
- They always require assemblers for translating instructions.
- Low-level languages do not have a very wide application in today‚Äôs times.
