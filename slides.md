###### What is Programming ?
# Purpose Of Programming

- Purpose of programming is to make human life better and easier. It does so because the computer programs can perform a set of tasks once we define them clearly.
    <br/>
    * Calculator
    * Automated Teller Machine (ATM)

- This saves a lot of human time and energy so that we can concentrate on other challenging tasks that cannot be automated.

<br/>

<blockquote>
"Everyone should learn how to program regardless of what profession we are doing. With this programming knowledge, we can optimize our task easily and efficiently"
</blockquote>

<!-- - What is the Purpose of Programming? 
- I mean, why do you do it and where is it going?

###### What is Programming ?
# The language of Code

<v-click>

- Computers only understand <mark>machine code</mark>
- A series of 1's and 0' fed and interpreted by the computer (BINARY)

</v-click>

###### What is Programming ?
# Binary

<v-click>

- A binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: typically "0" and "1". 
- Therefore, in order to talk to computer you must first translate your English instructions to Binary.
